# FuelCalculator

NASA Fuel Calculator: Application and CLI to calculate the fuel required for the flight.

## Installation

After checking out the repo, run `mix deps.get` to install dependencies. Then, run `mix test` to run the tests.

## Interactive prompt

Run `iex -S mix` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment:

~~~elixir
iex(1)> FuelCalculator.call(28801, [{:launch, "earth"}, {:land, "moon"}, {:launch, "moon"}, {:land, "earth"}])
51898
iex(2)> FuelCalculator.call(28801, [{:launch, "earth"}, {:launch, "moon"}, {:land, "earth"}])
{:error, "Invalid path"}
~~~

## Mission Path Requirements

The mission should start with launching and end with landing, — we should not leave the ship without fuel in the space. The path must be consistent: the launch of a ship from a planet must be immediately preceded by a landing on the same planet, for all planets on the path except the first. Any ship landing on a planet must be immediately preceded by a launch from any planet, which may or may not be another planet.

## CLI Installation

To create the executable command file, run `mix escript.build`. This overrides file `./fuel_calculator`. Create an alias in your bash profile file or a symlink to make the command globally available.

## CLI Usage

The CLI interface is simplified. The user specifies a mass of the ship (including equipment) and a list of planets, and the program plans an appropriate launch/land path for the mission and calculates the amount of fuel.

    $ ./fuel_calculator 28801 earth moon earth
    51898
